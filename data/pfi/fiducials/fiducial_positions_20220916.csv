# Positions of fiducials measured using x-y scanner at ASIAA,
# and applied transformation proposed in Kawanomoto's report
# (PFS-PFI-NAJ802206-04_Coordinates_YM2.pdf)
#
# x-y scanner data os from Richard Chou <cychou@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>, sent to Chi-Hung Yan 2021-05-24
#
# N.b. x_mm is swapped from the ASRD data to match the definitions on the summit
#
# Columns:
#  fiducialId    ID for fiducial
#  x_mm, y_mm    Position of object, in mm
